    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I have always been into algorithm and programming because i always like thinking about different ways to deal with
        a problem but i had little programming experience: 6 months in a startup company when i was senior student working 
        with C# making a kind of ERP program for small companies, a year after graduating university in a company related 
        with public company working with JSP caring about company's human resources module(mostly salaries and annual leaves).
        After that i switch to another profession and become an Air Traffic Controller and have been working in this 
        profession for 8 years but still being a hobbyist and loving programming languages 
        and seeing things working after completing code
